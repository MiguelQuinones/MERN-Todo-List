# Overview

This application will be designed as a todo list that users can interact with. Users will be able to add items to the list, edit items already in the list, and remove items from the list, following CRUD principles.

# Link to the Active Site

This application's front end is currently being hosted on GitHub Pages: https://miguelquinones.github.io/mern-todo-list/. However, in the future I plan on hosting elsewhere to have a working backend as well.

# TODO

Add functionality to remove tasks from list

Change background of pages to be dark-themed
